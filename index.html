      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <p> As a <a href="https://otterathletics.com/news/2016/6/2/womens-water-polo-veloso-tabbed-as-second-team-acwpc-all-america.aspx?mobile=skip">
          former student-athlete</a> I had the honor to achieve
        high-level competitions as an anthlete and successfuly graduate
        in Business Administration in California. As an athlete, and coming
        from a family of former high-level athletes, I am a true believer that
        high-level sports teach people many skills and "real-life" lessons. Besides
        being athletes, my parents also started a couple of businesses of their
        own. I believe growing up listening to their conversations and seeing them
        run their businesses strongly contributed to my career choice. However,
        the unexpected interest in programming was a good surpise I had when
        I took an advanced Excel class during university. During this class we
        learned macros, VBA, and how quickly I understood this "new language" and
        everything I could do with it fascinated me. Since then, I have been
        working with Business but I have also been researching and taking
        online courses to improve my programming skills.</p>

        <h3>Business</h3>
        <p>I was fortunated to experience various business functional areas
          with my family's businesses. The famous "do a little bit of everything" that often
          happens with small business owners improved my business skills in general.
          Despite successful experiences in other areas, my main business skills
          are related to the finance and accounting.

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>After discovering my programming skills during an advanced Excel
          class my curiosity lead me to research and take online courses to improve
          my skills. So far I am confident on my SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, and React.js skills.</p>
